# Quiz 1
## Which of the following is not one of the key challenges for AI diagnostic algorithms that is discussed in the lecture? 
A. Inflexible models

## You find that your training set has 70% negative examples and 30% positive. Which of the following techniques will NOT help for training this imbalanced dataset?
A. Oversampling negative results

A. 1.27

## What is the typical size of medical image dataset?
A. 10 thousands ~ 100 thousands images

## Which of the following are valid methods for determining ground truth?  Choose all that apply.
A. Confiromation by CT scan, Consensus voting for a board of doctors, Biopsy

## In what order should the training, validation, and test sets be sampled?
A. Test, Validation, Training

## Why is it bad to have patients in both training and test sets?
A. Overly optimistic test performance

## Let’s say you have a relatively small training set (~5 thousand images). Which training strategy makes the most sense?   
A. Retraining the last layer of a pre-trained model

## Now let’s say you have a very large dataset (~1 million images). Which training strategies will make the most sense?
A. 
- Retraining all of the layers of a pre-trained model
- Training with a randomly initialized network
